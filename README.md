# Boot with GRUB

Latex version of [the Wayne Marshall's article "Boot with GRUB" in Linux Journal from April 2001](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4622).

The article is very nice.
Much clearer than the GNU's current (version 2.00 from June 2012)
[manual on GRUB 2](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/index.html).
Conceptually, which is what a curious beginner often looks for, the two GRUBs are the same.


The repository hosts:
the `latex` file and 3 `jpeg` images of the article,
the `pdf` file, produced in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
